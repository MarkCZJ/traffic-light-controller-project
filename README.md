# must run on Wokwi

##################################################
# This project aims to create a two-way Traffic Light System using Wokwi Lab (an online electronic circuit simulator) and its built-in virtual esp32 microcontroller demo board. 
# At the same time, through C++, design and develop a bidirectional traffic light controller equipped with an LCD display 
# and an emergency light that can be remotely turned on and off via network.
